# 8.1 Process and Policy for adding new sumstats to inventory

Starting with an email 

Also, is there documentation for the pipeline that we use to clean sumstats? 
A collaborator wants to use the Danish pipeline (CSS) as well. 

Also, there are some additional sumstats that are high priority for cleaning for a collaborating group. 
I'll add them to the inventory. How long would it take to run the pipeline?

As for getting the sumstats in the correct format for processing, that is my job. I think we need to make clear where to put the files and to contact me when doing so. Then I will make the correct folders and list the files and locations for processing. 


## Collab group wants to use CSS
CSS is not publicly available  
- [ ] We need to see if we can share it CSS with them by asking Jesper
	- [ ] write an email

## Documentation for Pipeline
See [[04 Using cleansumstats]]


## High Priority Cleaning
Not happening soon

## Making Metadata file
https://biopsyk.github.io/metadata/#!/form/cleansumstats
https://github.com/BioPsyk/cleansumstats/blob/master/docs/input.md
- Don’t use `#` in column names
- Don’t use illegal characters like `+`  in the filenames
- Use integers
- Check the sumstats file to ensure there is a header
	- add one if needed

We also need to see who is importing it fills it out.

Also must ensure we update the GWAS_SUMSTAT repo with new metadata file

## Pre-process for CSS
Proposed steps (in no particular order):
	- 0. Take in new sumstats
	- 0. Make new folder in the RAW directory for them following the naming convention
	- 0. import the sumstat files to that folder
	- 1. Creating new metadata files
		- See above for how we are going to do that
		- using the webform etc
		- Updating the GWAS_SUMSTAT repo with the new metadata file
		- putting the metadata in the sumstat folder
	- 2. After this we should be able to run CSS


## Documenting processing in inventory sheet
Perhaps we should document which steps of processing the sumstats are in the inventory sheet?

Right now, there is only “downloaded”. Maybe we can also have sections to check whether it is in the pre-processing stage, the “ready” stage, whatever steps are really necessary to document.
