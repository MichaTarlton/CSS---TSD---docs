## **Definitions:**
This was spun out of [[BioPsyk.cleansumstats.README]] so I can interpret the data

**Positions:**
	Where it is in the genome I guess?

**From dbSNP**

>Description: 
> Chromosome base position on GRCh38 (current)
> 
>Search term Values and rules: 
> A natural number representing the SNP's start coordinate on its chromosome on the latest assembly (ie. GRCh38). Most useful when search in combination with the CHR field.

**RSIDS:**
	The rsID number is a unique label ("rs" followed by a number) used by researchers and databases to identify a specific SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism). It stands for Reference SNP cluster ID and is the naming convention used for most SNPs.

When researchers identify a SNP, they send a report (which includes the sequence immediately surrounding the SNP) to the [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) database. If overlapping reports are sent in, they are merged into the same, non-redundant Reference SNP cluster, which is assigned a unique rsID.

**Effect Alleles:**

**dbSNP:**
	The **Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DbSNP#cite_note-1) (dbSNP) is a free public archive for [genetic variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation "Genetic variation") within and across different [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") developed and hosted by the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information "National Center for Biotechnology Information") (NCBI) in collaboration with the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Human_Genome_Research_Institute "National Human Genome Research Institute") (NHGRI). Although the name of the database implies a collection of one class of [polymorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology) "Polymorphism (biology)") only (i.e., [single nucleotide polymorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_nucleotide_polymorphisms "Single nucleotide polymorphisms") (SNPs)), it in fact contains a range of molecular variation: (1) [SNPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNPs "SNPs"), (2) short deletion and insertion polymorphisms ([indels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indels "Indels")/DIPs), (3) [microsatellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics) "Microsatellite (genetics)") markers or [short tandem repeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_tandem_repeats "Short tandem repeats") (STRs), (4) multinucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), (5) heterozygous sequences, and (6) named variants.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DbSNP#cite_note-Sherry2-2) The dbSNP accepts apparently neutral polymorphisms, polymorphisms corresponding to known phenotypes, and regions of no variation. It was created in September 1998 to supplement [GenBank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank "GenBank"), NCBIâ€™s collection of publicly available nucleic acid and protein sequences.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DbSNP#cite_note-Sherry2-2)
