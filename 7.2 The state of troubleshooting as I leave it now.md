# 7.2 The state of troubleshooting as I leave it now

So most of my troubleshooting I have documented in [[7.1 Troubleshooting uncleaned sumstats]] but I will leave the last comments of what I have done here.

## Routine preprocessing of the susmtats files
Based on the troubleshooting I have created a slurm job script (**[[SLURMPY4.JOB]]**) that calls to a python script (**[[modfile.py]]**) in order to perform changes to the sumstat file before running it through CSS.

I have stored these and some variants (designed to address specific issues I ran into) are in my login node working folder copy found here in this repository. Specifically I have put these under a folder called **“production_scripts”**

### How the slurm jobscript works

To start, we want to create a copy of both the metadata and the raw sumstat file it refers to, from the original `SUMSTATv2_RAW` study folder and place the copies in a temporary folder where we can manipulate our copies to be prepared for CSS. From here on I will refer to this as the **FLY** folder (short for “on-the-fly”). 

>[!NOTE] 
>I made a location for these fly folders in my personal cluster user directory, and as of the moment they are not really temporary, as the script doesn’t delete them afterwards.

Because the original study folder in `SUMSTATv2_RAW` can contain multiple sumstats and metadata, and with large filesizes, we would prefer to make sure our script will only copy the one metadata and sumstat file pair that we want. We go ahead and copy the metadata to the *fly* folder as we already know the file we want.

**The way it is designed,** it takes the input cleansumstats_meta path, divides the path that you have given it into two variables: the *path to the folder where it is located*, and the name of the metadata file itself.  

We pass both of these variables (as well as the path to the original metadata file) into our python script. Which, we first initialize the environment for and import the needed libraries `pandas` and `pyyaml`. 

Inside our python script, **modfile.py**, we open and tread the metadata file using the the python yaml reader. From here it reads the yaml field `"path_sumStats"` which is the name of the desired sumstats file. We then concatenate the path to the original study folder with the name of the desired sumstat file.

Using pandas we load the sumstat file into pandas. Make the modifications, in this case stripping the white space and converting the table into a tsv file upon saving. And when we save it, we now save it in our *fly* folder. 

In the future the python script stage could be used to modify even the metadata file or anything else we would like to do in a python environment to pre-process our files for CSS.

This is the end of the python script and we return to the rest of the slurm jobscript 

**Here,** the rest of the slurm job script continues as normal *except* the cleansumstats metadata we pass into CSS is from the fly folder. Because CSS looks for the susmtat file in the same folder that contains the metadata, CSS will find our processed sumstat file here.
