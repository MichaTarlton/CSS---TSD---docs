# Troubleshooting uncleaned sumstats
**AS OF [[16.03.22]] THIS IS THE AUTHORATATIVE DOC ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF ALL SUMSTATS INITIALL FOUND ON THE UNCLEANED LIST.**

**THE OLDER DOCUMENTS BELOW ARE NOT CLEAR AND NOT UP TO DATE**

The list of “uncleaned sumstats” is here, and is what is referenced to by line number in everywhere in this document.  
[[20. Academia/01 NORMENT/cleansumstats/uncleanedlist.txt]]

## Depreceated old docs
List of documented issues I made: [[Documented Issues with uncleaned sumstats]]
Taken from the text file in my login node scratch directory: `Documented issues with the 19 - 98.txt`
[[Issues_update.txt]] Precursor to the above list
[[Jobs which failed due to error in the metafile]] ANother doc but only about meta data regex errors
