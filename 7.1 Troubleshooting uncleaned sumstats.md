# Troubleshooting uncleaned sumstats
**AS OF [[16.03.22]] THIS IS THE AUTHORATATIVE DOC ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF ALL SUMSTATS INITIALL FOUND ON THE UNCLEANED LIST.**


The list of “uncleaned sumstats” is here, and is what is referenced to by line number in everywhere in this document.  
[[20. Academia/01 NORMENT/CSS Documentation/cleansumstats/uncleanedlist.txt]]

## Depreceated old docs
**THE OLDER DOCUMENTS BELOW ARE NOT CLEAR AND NOT UP TO DATE**
List of documented issues I made: [[Documented Issues with uncleaned sumstats]]
Taken from the text file in my login node scratch directory: `Documented issues with the 19 - 98.txt`
[[Issues_update.txt]] Precursor to the above list
[[Jobs which failed due to error in the metafile]] Another doc but only about meta data regex errors


# Outstanding Issues
### 80-84: NORMENT_BRAINSTEMS
- `col_CHR: #CHROM`
- not sure what this should be changed to
- The error is `null found, string expected`
See ![[cleansumstats tasks#Norment Brainstem Inventory]]
80 NORMENT_BRAINSTEMVOLUMES_2019_Medulla
81 NORMENT_BRAINSTEMVOLUMES_2019_Midbrain
82 NORMENT_BRAINSTEMVOLUMES_2019_Pons
83 NORMENT_BRAINSTEMVOLUMES_2019_SCP
84 NORMENT_BRAINSTEMVOLUMES_2019_Whole


### 85-86: PGC_ASD_2017
As expected they are missing a header row.
[[29.03.22]] Gleda is fixing this
[[31.03.22]] Gleda has fixed this more or less. Check with her on status.

# Unknown status
It does appear I skipped these purposefully but idk why. Possible oversight, but I want to think something else is at hand

### 19 BCX_Blood_2020_BAS_EA
- Can’t find any slurm logs for this one
### 94 PGC_SCZ_0418b
- slurm log documents a broken pipe error
### 95 PGC_SCZ_0818a_w3_no_w2

# Marked as Fixed

This may have been as simple as just rerunning them.
**Did I save them to SUMSTATv2_dev?** [[22.03.22]]
- They are present **but not finished** in my sandbox
	- As in they do not seem to have the finished pasted together sumstat file
- **THEY ARE NOT IN LIVE DEV FOLDER** instead they are in my sandbox SUMSTATv2_dev folder
- [[28.03.22]] I have moved them to my **SUMSTATv3_FINAL** folder:

## Fixed as of 01.03.22
Pretty sure with these I just made changes to the metadata file names to remove illegal characters and updated the GWAS_SUMSTATS repo
### Issue: “number found, integer expected” 

**[[22.03.22]] Fixed in GWAS_SUMSTATS repo, not deployed**
Did I run these after fixing?
I don’t think so. Rerun them as soon as new metadata is deployed.

[[28.03.22]] Moved the metadata over and running a slurm job Should be fixed and in my OUT folder by end of day.

Check to see if fix worked then move to FINAL folder
Also, running this with the python slurm jobscript which isn’t necessary but let’s see what happens.

[[29.03.22]] **FINISHED AND MOVED TO FINAL FOLDER**

### Issue: “$.path_sumStats: does not match the regex pattern”

**[[22.03.22]] FIX IS NOT DEPLOYED** 
Fix to metadata deployed to GWAS_SUMSTATS
**CHANGE TO LIVE RAW FOLDER SUMSTAT FILE NAMES HAS NOT BEEN DONE**
Next steps:
	1. Change the live sumstat file names to match the new metadata path
		1. In most cases this is a simple case of replacing `+` with `-`
		2. You can look at the file changes to the metadata to ensure
	2. Deploy GWAS_SUMSTATS
	3. Rerun CSS on them

[[28.03.22]] Making the slurm  job for step 3
[[29.03.22]] FINISHED AND MOVED to final

### Issue: Unknown 33,52,54,92,93,42,39,58,57,56,55,51,50,49,53,87,79,88,91,92*
Returned a "broken pipe" type error. See Error logs
As of [[23.03.22]]I believe I have created a python fix and created a slurm job to implement it. I will expand on this in a bit.

Right now it appears to be working with 33, I will extend this to the others.

The final outputs should be found in my cluster user folder under **SUMSTATv3_OUT**


#### 33 BROADABC_ASB_2017
- **Fixed** as of yesteday. Successfully ran it via slurm and output it to my personal SUMSTATv3_OUT folder 
- See [[cleansumstats tasks#Rerunning “BRoken PIpe” errors]]
- And [[cleansumstats tasks#Fixing 33 BROADABC_ASB_2017]]

##### WORKED AFTER NEW PYSCRIPT
SEE FOLDER `production_scripts` and `slurpy_test_` for the slurm files
**HOWEVER DUE TO A BUG IN MY CODE THE CONCAT FEATURE WAS NOT WORKING AND THESE ALL NEED TO BE CONCATENATED**

[[25.03.22]] These have since been concatenated

##### DID NOT WORK AFTER NEW PYSCRIPT
92 - Moved to it’s own subsection 

###  92 PGC_MDD_2018_no23andMe
- Something about an error with the path to the sumstats file
- Originally returned a broken pipe error but that was fixed by use of the new pyscript
- See original issue (stripping whitespace I think) lower below
- Why is there an apparently finished copy in my sandbox OUT folder if the original slurm log was that it broke
- According to the original slurm log it failed to read/validate the metadata file
	- Which when I investigated appeared to occur because the python script failed to copy the file to the “fly” work directory
	- This is all mentioned in the slurm log `slurm-13961783_92.out`
	- simply the py script failed to find it at the step where it was supposed to read it
	- so I believe this means it failed to copy it
	- **I encountered a permissions issue when just checking on it so perhaps that is the cause**
	- I found a shell where I was running it piecemeal and the py script appeared to have worked anyways?
	- I am running CSS in that shell let’s see what the outcome is. It should write out to my sandbox OUT folder
- Ok I think it just worked for whatever reason when I ran it manually?
